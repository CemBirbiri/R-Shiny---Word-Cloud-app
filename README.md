This project is creating a Word Cloud app using Shiny/R. 

It uses the Wasabi dataset, spesifically the song Genres and their lyric summaries. In the dataset there are songs and they have different genres. First the songs are grouped by genre. For each song of a genre, the lyric summaries collected and represented as a word cloud. The dataset can be found here:

https://github.com/micbuffa/WasabiDataset

However, you don't have to download the dataset here. All the data is avalable on GENRES folder.

Detailed explanation of the Shiny project can be found in the Report.pdf

Word Cloud is a vizualisation method that displays how frequently words appear in a given body of text, by making the size of each word proportional to its frequency. Colour used on Word Clouds is usually meaningless. The location of the word is also meaningless. Some words are written horizontally and some are written vertically which are random and do not mean anything. Only meaning feature in the word cloud is the size of the word.

How to run the code:

1- Download R Studio
2- Download the "R-Shiny Word Cloud app" directory to your local computer. It has all the dataset and the code. 
3- Open the app.R file in R Studio
4- Press "shift-command-enter" on MAC
5- Press "shift-ctrl-enter" on other operating systems
6- You will see the Shiny app and word cloud. Enjoy!
